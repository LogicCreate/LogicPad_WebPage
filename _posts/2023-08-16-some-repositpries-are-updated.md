# Some repositories are updated.

The following repositories are updated.

- GObject tutorial

## GTK4 tutorial

- All the contents have been reviewed and rewritten. Now it covers GTK version 4.10.
- Some bugs are fixed.
- Many programs are modified and improved.
- A new section, drag and drop, is added.

GTK version 4.10 adds some new classes and make some old classes deprecated.
For example, GtkFileChooserDialog is replaced by GtkFileDialog.
The change was pretty wide so the tutorial has also been changed a lot.
