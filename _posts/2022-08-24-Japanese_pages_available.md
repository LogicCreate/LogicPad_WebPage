Japanese pages are now available.

But it doesn't work perfectly because Jekyll supports only one post directory.
So, the posts in English and Japanese are mixed in a single directory and they both are seen in either page in English and Japanese.
At the beginning of each message, 'en:' or 'ja:' is prepended and they indicate the language.

When you see a Japanese page, the links at the top of the windows point Japanese pages.
If you want to move to an English page, click 'Einglsh' at the right of the inks.
Then you'll move to the top page in English.

Maybe you need some experiences to get used to using the links in the site.
I will improved this in the future if GitHub pages takes jekyll-paginate-v2 plugin for collection pagination.
