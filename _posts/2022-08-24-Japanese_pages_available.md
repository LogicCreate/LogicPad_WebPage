Japanese pages are now available.

But it doesn't work perfectly because Jekyll-pagination supports only one post directory.
So, the posted messages are listed in one page \-\- no pagination.

Messages in English and Japanese are displayed in English page and Japanese one respectively.
If you want to see Japanese messages, move to the Japanese page.
You can switch the languages by clicking the top right link, which is "English" or "日本語".
